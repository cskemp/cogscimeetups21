### COVID-19 Guidelines 

Each meetup group is expected to follow local policies related to COVID-19. This may include policies that:

* require an on-campus event to be registered with the host university
* require attendees to supply contact details for contact tracing if needed 
* limit the total number of attendees

The meetup organizer is responsible for finding out about relevant local policies and making sure that they are followed. If a local outbreak emerges, it may turn out that a meetup group is unable to go ahead.
